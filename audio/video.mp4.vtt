00:00.000 --> 00:08.740
Because I'm a college professor, I'm going to start with a pop quiz.

00:08.760 --> 00:14.880
I want you to think of the best college in the country,

00:14.900 --> 00:18.980
one that you would absolutely love to get into,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.840
one that would change your life completely.

00:22.860 --> 00:25.180
Okay, do you have it?

00:25.200 --> 00:27.960
I'm guessing if I went to the audience right now

00:27.960 --> 00:32.620
and asked a hundred different people which college they chose,

00:32.640 --> 00:37.820
I'd hear the same names over and over and over again.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.700
And that's because we have a huge problem in higher education.

00:42.720 --> 00:46.380
We say we want colleges to be more equitable,

00:46.400 --> 00:50.440
more transformational, more accessible.

00:50.460 --> 00:54.580
But we tend to obsess over a tiny group of colleges

00:54.600 --> 00:57.500
most of us could never get into.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.120
And it's not because we aren't smart enough.

01:00.140 --> 01:03.420
It's because there isn't enough space for all of us.

01:03.440 --> 01:08.620
These schools intentionally cap the number of students that they accept.

01:08.640 --> 01:12.860
It's why Achille Bello, an advocate for fairness in college admissions,

01:12.880 --> 01:14.900
calls them something else.

01:14.920 --> 01:18.400
They're not prestigious universities.

01:18.420 --> 01:21.280
They're highly rejective colleges.

01:21.280 --> 01:27.760
I'm not saying these schools are bad.

01:27.780 --> 01:32.700
Places like Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Princeton, MIT,

01:32.720 --> 01:35.260
and I'm not saying these schools are bad.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.060
They're obviously major research institutions.

01:39.080 --> 01:42.860
But our cultural obsession with a limited group

01:42.880 --> 01:48.260
of highly rejective colleges has major consequences.

01:48.260 --> 01:52.360
I'm a person in my immediate family to graduate from college.

01:52.380 --> 01:59.160
And Portland State University,

01:59.180 --> 02:02.800
a regional public university in Portland, Oregon,

02:02.820 --> 02:05.860
truly changed my life.

02:05.880 --> 02:10.120
But for a long time,

02:10.140 --> 02:14.580
when someone at a networking event asked me where I went to college,

02:14.580 --> 02:20.620
I worried that they judged my intellect and my aspirations when I answered.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.920
Now I research higher education

02:22.940 --> 02:27.900
to understand how our perceptions of which colleges are good

02:27.920 --> 02:32.720
shape important decisions we make about which schools to fund,

02:32.740 --> 02:37.360
donate to, attend, and send our children to.

02:37.380 --> 02:41.420
Regional public universities, or RPUs for short,

02:41.420 --> 02:45.680
are the exact opposite of highly rejective colleges.

02:45.700 --> 02:50.560
You can spot them because their name tells you which communities they serve.

02:50.580 --> 02:53.480
Western Colorado University,

02:53.500 --> 02:55.840
Northern Kentucky University,

02:55.860 --> 02:58.560
Eastern Washington University.

02:58.580 --> 03:02.440
In New York, they're the SUNY and the CUNY schools.

03:02.460 --> 03:07.700
In California, they're the 23 CSU campuses.

03:07.700 --> 03:11.840
They're called normal schools in China, Fauschulen in Germany,

03:11.860 --> 03:16.020
and provincial colleges in Canada and Italy.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.960
These are the universities that train the nurses

03:19.980 --> 03:22.960
who take care of you when you go to the hospital,

03:22.980 --> 03:25.880
the school teachers who educate your children,

03:25.900 --> 03:31.360
and the small business leaders that create jobs in your hometown.

03:31.380 --> 03:34.240
Regional public universities, or RPUs,

03:34.240 --> 03:40.360
pride themselves on accepting everyone, or almost everyone who applies.

03:40.380 --> 03:44.340
And RPUs students are more likely to be first-generation college students

03:44.360 --> 03:49.040
like I was, students of color, low-income students,

03:49.060 --> 03:55.100
veterans, and adults balancing work and family while going to school.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.260
And RPUs students often don't have the test scores required

03:59.280 --> 04:01.700
to get into a highly rejective college,

04:01.700 --> 04:04.180
not because they aren't capable,

04:04.200 --> 04:10.840
but because they weren't given the same advantages as other students.

04:10.860 --> 04:17.560
My mother was a brilliant woman who had an eighth grade education,

04:17.580 --> 04:21.020
and she died when she was just 43 years old

04:21.040 --> 04:24.920
of a totally preventable asthma attack,

04:24.940 --> 04:27.720
because she lived in a rural remote community

04:27.720 --> 04:32.120
and lacked access to health care.

04:32.140 --> 04:37.040
I grew up in poverty, and my test scores were lower,

04:37.060 --> 04:41.060
because I prepared for the SATs by showing up on test day

04:41.080 --> 04:44.800
with a sharpened number two pencil and a calculator,

04:44.820 --> 04:48.200
rather than taking expensive test prep courses.

04:49.480 --> 04:53.840
People sometimes talk about regional public universities

04:53.840 --> 04:58.660
in negative ways by calling some the 13th grade

04:58.680 --> 05:02.980
or saying, anyone can get in, as if that's a bad thing,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.540
or saying they're not real universities.

05:06.560 --> 05:11.820
But shouldn't colleges be judged by how many people they include

05:11.840 --> 05:15.940
and raised to the same level of academic excellence,

05:15.960 --> 05:19.560
rather than by how many people they exclude,

05:19.560 --> 05:26.000
by how well they address the pressing challenges facing their local communities?

05:26.020 --> 05:30.860
Take Adams State University in southern rural Colorado.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.300
Thirty-eight percent of the university's students are Latinx,

05:34.320 --> 05:39.180
and half are first in their families to go to college.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.780
This is Colorado's most affordable university,

05:42.800 --> 05:46.340
and it's one of just a few in the entire country

05:46.340 --> 05:50.160
to offer graduate degrees to students who are currently incarcerated

05:50.180 --> 05:52.640
and working to change their lives.

05:52.660 --> 05:58.860
It contributes $83.5 million each year to the local economy.

06:00.320 --> 06:04.520
Regional public universities like Adams State University

06:04.540 --> 06:09.620
generate more upward mobility than any other type of college.

06:09.640 --> 06:14.680
But you'll never find it on a list of America's most prestigious universities,

06:14.680 --> 06:18.220
and it doesn't get the funding it deserves.

06:18.240 --> 06:23.660
Ironically, the colleges that already have the largest endowments

06:23.680 --> 06:28.200
tend to receive the biggest charitable donations.

06:28.220 --> 06:33.340
Recently, Michael Bloomberg gave Johns Hopkins University

06:33.360 --> 06:38.040
a donation of $1.8 billion.

06:38.060 --> 06:41.140
And this is an incredibly generous gift.

06:41.140 --> 06:48.560
But before the donation, Johns Hopkins had an endowment of $3.8 billion.

06:48.580 --> 06:54.720
And it rejects 89 percent of all students who apply.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.360
By contrast,

06:56.380 --> 06:58.420
Adams State University,

06:58.440 --> 07:03.780
which prides itself by accepting the top 99 percent of students,

07:03.800 --> 07:08.000
has an endowment of just $63,000.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.440
Not million, not billion, $63,000.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.320
Shockingly low.

07:16.340 --> 07:19.380
Now, Johns Hopkins produces vital research,

07:19.400 --> 07:23.060
but let's imagine if Michael Bloomberg had spread that donation

07:23.080 --> 07:26.900
across the 430 RPUs in the country,

07:26.920 --> 07:31.040
each would have received $4 million.

07:31.060 --> 07:37.300
Now, imagine if your net worth went from being $63,000 to $4 million.

07:37.300 --> 07:40.940
Your life would be pretty different, wouldn't it?

07:40.960 --> 07:44.880
Unfortunately, the government only makes this issue worse.

07:44.900 --> 07:47.540
In the United States and throughout the world,

07:47.560 --> 07:52.140
far more public funding goes to highly-rejective colleges

07:52.160 --> 07:55.120
than to regional public universities.

07:55.140 --> 07:59.940
Because of this, RPUs have become more expensive,

07:59.960 --> 08:02.280
which hurts low-income students

08:02.300 --> 08:06.820
and has caused student loan debt to Skyrocket.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.080
If I were 18 years old right now,

08:10.100 --> 08:14.620
I honestly don't know if I could afford to go to college,

08:14.640 --> 08:17.960
given how much tuition has increased

08:17.980 --> 08:20.800
and how little public funding has kept up.

08:22.120 --> 08:28.520
If we really want more low-income students to go to college,

08:28.540 --> 08:33.080
if we really want equity in higher education,

08:33.080 --> 08:38.700
we need to put our money where our mouth is and fund regional public universities.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.900
Now, many of us have been on the receiving end of calls

08:42.920 --> 08:45.040
from our alumni association,

08:45.060 --> 08:48.860
and I don't think the ink was drawn on my diploma when my phone rang.

08:49.860 --> 08:53.500
For my generous friends who may have gone to a highly-rejective college,

08:53.520 --> 08:55.880
and don't worry, I'm not mad at you,

08:55.880 --> 09:03.180
but instead of giving to your alma mater, which is probably already very wealthy,

09:03.200 --> 09:06.900
consider giving it to the colleges that really need it,

09:06.920 --> 09:10.560
to the RPUs that truly serve their communities.

09:11.500 --> 09:15.580
Last year, billionaire philanthropist Mackenzie Scott

09:15.600 --> 09:21.980
gave $1.5 billion to 73 different colleges and universities

09:21.980 --> 09:25.940
that serve low-income students and students of color.

09:26.820 --> 09:30.860
Xavier University of Louisiana, maybe not a household name,

09:30.880 --> 09:34.620
but did you know that they send more black graduates to medical school

09:34.640 --> 09:37.340
than any other college in the country?

09:37.360 --> 09:39.280
She gave them $20 million,

09:39.300 --> 09:40.700
and guess what?

09:40.720 --> 09:43.940
That was the largest gift they had ever received.

09:43.960 --> 09:47.520
And that was true for most of the schools on her list.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.820
Places like Long Beach City College,

09:49.820 --> 09:52.020
the University of Central Florida,

09:52.040 --> 09:53.960
CSU Northridge,

09:53.980 --> 09:57.760
many of these schools are regional public universities

09:57.780 --> 10:01.040
that so rarely get large donations,

10:01.060 --> 10:04.000
that her gift was transformative.

10:05.220 --> 10:11.080
There's no better way than to make a difference in higher education

10:11.100 --> 10:13.560
than to give to the colleges

10:13.580 --> 10:17.440
that change the lives of their students and communities.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.780
But this isn't all about money.

10:20.500 --> 10:25.700
We all have the power to change the way we think about

10:25.720 --> 10:29.300
and talk about regional public universities,

10:29.320 --> 10:33.260
or stop people when they frame them in negative ways.

10:33.780 --> 10:35.740
So when you hear someone saying,

10:35.760 --> 10:38.220
oh, anyone can get into that school,

10:38.240 --> 10:40.780
push them on why that's a bad thing,

10:40.800 --> 10:42.820
you don't have to be rude about it,

10:42.840 --> 10:45.180
you could just say, wow,

10:45.180 --> 10:48.160
wow, that's amazing,

10:48.180 --> 10:51.320
that that school gives so many people

10:51.340 --> 10:54.120
the opportunity to go to college.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.960
I'm living proof

10:59.000 --> 11:01.360
that no matter where you were born,

11:02.580 --> 11:06.000
or how much money your parents have,

11:06.020 --> 11:10.000
you should have the opportunity to go to a college

11:10.000 --> 11:15.140
that supports your growth and fosters your dreams.

11:15.160 --> 11:19.140
When we change the way we define prestige

11:19.160 --> 11:23.860
and fund regional public universities,

11:23.880 --> 11:28.120
we will make higher education equitable once and for all.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.300
Thank you.

11:29.300 --> 11:43.080
Yeah, you can call them.
