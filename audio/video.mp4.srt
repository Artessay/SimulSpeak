1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,740
Because I'm a college professor, I'm going to start with a pop quiz.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,880
I want you to think of the best college in the country,

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,980
one that you would absolutely love to get into,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,840
one that would change your life completely.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,180
Okay, do you have it?

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,960
I'm guessing if I went to the audience right now

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,620
and asked a hundred different people which college they chose,

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,820
I'd hear the same names over and over and over again.

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,700
And that's because we have a huge problem in higher education.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,380
We say we want colleges to be more equitable,

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,440
more transformational, more accessible.

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,580
But we tend to obsess over a tiny group of colleges

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,500
most of us could never get into.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,120
And it's not because we aren't smart enough.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,420
It's because there isn't enough space for all of us.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,620
These schools intentionally cap the number of students that they accept.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,860
It's why Achille Bello, an advocate for fairness in college admissions,

18
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,900
calls them something else.

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,400
They're not prestigious universities.

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,280
They're highly rejective colleges.

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm not saying these schools are bad.

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,700
Places like Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Princeton, MIT,

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,260
and I'm not saying these schools are bad.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,060
They're obviously major research institutions.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,860
But our cultural obsession with a limited group

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,260
of highly rejective colleges has major consequences.

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,360
I'm a person in my immediate family to graduate from college.

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:59,160
And Portland State University,

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,800
a regional public university in Portland, Oregon,

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,860
truly changed my life.

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,120
But for a long time,

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,580
when someone at a networking event asked me where I went to college,

33
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,620
I worried that they judged my intellect and my aspirations when I answered.

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,920
Now I research higher education

35
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,900
to understand how our perceptions of which colleges are good

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,720
shape important decisions we make about which schools to fund,

37
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,360
donate to, attend, and send our children to.

38
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,420
Regional public universities, or RPUs for short,

39
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,680
are the exact opposite of highly rejective colleges.

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,560
You can spot them because their name tells you which communities they serve.

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,480
Western Colorado University,

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,840
Northern Kentucky University,

43
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,560
Eastern Washington University.

44
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,440
In New York, they're the SUNY and the CUNY schools.

45
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,700
In California, they're the 23 CSU campuses.

46
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,840
They're called normal schools in China, Fauschulen in Germany,

47
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,020
and provincial colleges in Canada and Italy.

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,960
These are the universities that train the nurses

49
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,960
who take care of you when you go to the hospital,

50
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,880
the school teachers who educate your children,

51
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,360
and the small business leaders that create jobs in your hometown.

52
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,240
Regional public universities, or RPUs,

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,360
pride themselves on accepting everyone, or almost everyone who applies.

54
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,340
And RPUs students are more likely to be first-generation college students

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,040
like I was, students of color, low-income students,

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,100
veterans, and adults balancing work and family while going to school.

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,260
And RPUs students often don't have the test scores required

58
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,700
to get into a highly rejective college,

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,180
not because they aren't capable,

60
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,840
but because they weren't given the same advantages as other students.

61
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,560
My mother was a brilliant woman who had an eighth grade education,

62
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,020
and she died when she was just 43 years old

63
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,920
of a totally preventable asthma attack,

64
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,720
because she lived in a rural remote community

65
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,120
and lacked access to health care.

66
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,040
I grew up in poverty, and my test scores were lower,

67
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,060
because I prepared for the SATs by showing up on test day

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,800
with a sharpened number two pencil and a calculator,

69
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,200
rather than taking expensive test prep courses.

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,840
People sometimes talk about regional public universities

71
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,660
in negative ways by calling some the 13th grade

72
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,980
or saying, anyone can get in, as if that's a bad thing,

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,540
or saying they're not real universities.

74
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,820
But shouldn't colleges be judged by how many people they include

75
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,940
and raised to the same level of academic excellence,

76
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,560
rather than by how many people they exclude,

77
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,000
by how well they address the pressing challenges facing their local communities?

78
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,860
Take Adams State University in southern rural Colorado.

79
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,300
Thirty-eight percent of the university's students are Latinx,

80
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,180
and half are first in their families to go to college.

81
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,780
This is Colorado's most affordable university,

82
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,340
and it's one of just a few in the entire country

83
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,160
to offer graduate degrees to students who are currently incarcerated

84
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,640
and working to change their lives.

85
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,860
It contributes $83.5 million each year to the local economy.

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,520
Regional public universities like Adams State University

87
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,620
generate more upward mobility than any other type of college.

88
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,680
But you'll never find it on a list of America's most prestigious universities,

89
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,220
and it doesn't get the funding it deserves.

90
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,660
Ironically, the colleges that already have the largest endowments

91
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,200
tend to receive the biggest charitable donations.

92
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,340
Recently, Michael Bloomberg gave Johns Hopkins University

93
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,040
a donation of $1.8 billion.

94
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,140
And this is an incredibly generous gift.

95
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:48,560
But before the donation, Johns Hopkins had an endowment of $3.8 billion.

96
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,720
And it rejects 89 percent of all students who apply.

97
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,360
By contrast,

98
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,420
Adams State University,

99
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,780
which prides itself by accepting the top 99 percent of students,

100
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,000
has an endowment of just $63,000.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,440
Not million, not billion, $63,000.

102
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,320
Shockingly low.

103
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,380
Now, Johns Hopkins produces vital research,

104
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,060
but let's imagine if Michael Bloomberg had spread that donation

105
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,900
across the 430 RPUs in the country,

106
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,040
each would have received $4 million.

107
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,300
Now, imagine if your net worth went from being $63,000 to $4 million.

108
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,940
Your life would be pretty different, wouldn't it?

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,880
Unfortunately, the government only makes this issue worse.

110
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,540
In the United States and throughout the world,

111
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,140
far more public funding goes to highly-rejective colleges

112
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,120
than to regional public universities.

113
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,940
Because of this, RPUs have become more expensive,

114
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,280
which hurts low-income students

115
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,820
and has caused student loan debt to Skyrocket.

116
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,080
If I were 18 years old right now,

117
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,620
I honestly don't know if I could afford to go to college,

118
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,960
given how much tuition has increased

119
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,800
and how little public funding has kept up.

120
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,520
If we really want more low-income students to go to college,

121
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,080
if we really want equity in higher education,

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,700
we need to put our money where our mouth is and fund regional public universities.

123
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,900
Now, many of us have been on the receiving end of calls

124
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,040
from our alumni association,

125
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,860
and I don't think the ink was drawn on my diploma when my phone rang.

126
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,500
For my generous friends who may have gone to a highly-rejective college,

127
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,880
and don't worry, I'm not mad at you,

128
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:03,180
but instead of giving to your alma mater, which is probably already very wealthy,

129
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,900
consider giving it to the colleges that really need it,

130
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,560
to the RPUs that truly serve their communities.

131
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,580
Last year, billionaire philanthropist Mackenzie Scott

132
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,980
gave $1.5 billion to 73 different colleges and universities

133
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,940
that serve low-income students and students of color.

134
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,860
Xavier University of Louisiana, maybe not a household name,

135
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,620
but did you know that they send more black graduates to medical school

136
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,340
than any other college in the country?

137
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,280
She gave them $20 million,

138
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,700
and guess what?

139
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,940
That was the largest gift they had ever received.

140
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,520
And that was true for most of the schools on her list.

141
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,820
Places like Long Beach City College,

142
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,020
the University of Central Florida,

143
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,960
CSU Northridge,

144
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,760
many of these schools are regional public universities

145
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,040
that so rarely get large donations,

146
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,000
that her gift was transformative.

147
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,080
There's no better way than to make a difference in higher education

148
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,560
than to give to the colleges

149
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,440
that change the lives of their students and communities.

150
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,780
But this isn't all about money.

151
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,700
We all have the power to change the way we think about

152
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,300
and talk about regional public universities,

153
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,260
or stop people when they frame them in negative ways.

154
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,740
So when you hear someone saying,

155
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,220
oh, anyone can get into that school,

156
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,780
push them on why that's a bad thing,

157
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,820
you don't have to be rude about it,

158
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,180
you could just say, wow,

159
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,160
wow, that's amazing,

160
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,320
that that school gives so many people

161
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,120
the opportunity to go to college.

162
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,960
I'm living proof

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,360
that no matter where you were born,

164
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,000
or how much money your parents have,

165
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,000
you should have the opportunity to go to a college

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,140
that supports your growth and fosters your dreams.

167
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,140
When we change the way we define prestige

168
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,860
and fund regional public universities,

169
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,120
we will make higher education equitable once and for all.

170
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,300
Thank you.

171
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:43,080
Yeah, you can call them.
