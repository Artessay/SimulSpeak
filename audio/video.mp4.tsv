0	8740	Because I'm a college professor, I'm going to start with a pop quiz.
8760	14880	I want you to think of the best college in the country,
14900	18980	one that you would absolutely love to get into,
19000	22840	one that would change your life completely.
22860	25180	Okay, do you have it?
25200	27960	I'm guessing if I went to the audience right now
27960	32620	and asked a hundred different people which college they chose,
32640	37820	I'd hear the same names over and over and over again.
37840	42700	And that's because we have a huge problem in higher education.
42720	46380	We say we want colleges to be more equitable,
46400	50440	more transformational, more accessible.
50460	54580	But we tend to obsess over a tiny group of colleges
54600	57500	most of us could never get into.
57500	60120	And it's not because we aren't smart enough.
60140	63420	It's because there isn't enough space for all of us.
63440	68620	These schools intentionally cap the number of students that they accept.
68640	72860	It's why Achille Bello, an advocate for fairness in college admissions,
72880	74900	calls them something else.
74920	78400	They're not prestigious universities.
78420	81280	They're highly rejective colleges.
81280	87760	I'm not saying these schools are bad.
87780	92700	Places like Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Princeton, MIT,
92720	95260	and I'm not saying these schools are bad.
95280	99060	They're obviously major research institutions.
99080	102860	But our cultural obsession with a limited group
102880	108260	of highly rejective colleges has major consequences.
108260	112360	I'm a person in my immediate family to graduate from college.
112380	119160	And Portland State University,
119180	122800	a regional public university in Portland, Oregon,
122820	125860	truly changed my life.
125880	130120	But for a long time,
130140	134580	when someone at a networking event asked me where I went to college,
134580	140620	I worried that they judged my intellect and my aspirations when I answered.
140640	142920	Now I research higher education
142940	147900	to understand how our perceptions of which colleges are good
147920	152720	shape important decisions we make about which schools to fund,
152740	157360	donate to, attend, and send our children to.
157380	161420	Regional public universities, or RPUs for short,
161420	165680	are the exact opposite of highly rejective colleges.
165700	170560	You can spot them because their name tells you which communities they serve.
170580	173480	Western Colorado University,
173500	175840	Northern Kentucky University,
175860	178560	Eastern Washington University.
178580	182440	In New York, they're the SUNY and the CUNY schools.
182460	187700	In California, they're the 23 CSU campuses.
187700	191840	They're called normal schools in China, Fauschulen in Germany,
191860	196020	and provincial colleges in Canada and Italy.
196040	199960	These are the universities that train the nurses
199980	202960	who take care of you when you go to the hospital,
202980	205880	the school teachers who educate your children,
205900	211360	and the small business leaders that create jobs in your hometown.
211380	214240	Regional public universities, or RPUs,
214240	220360	pride themselves on accepting everyone, or almost everyone who applies.
220380	224340	And RPUs students are more likely to be first-generation college students
224360	229040	like I was, students of color, low-income students,
229060	235100	veterans, and adults balancing work and family while going to school.
235120	239260	And RPUs students often don't have the test scores required
239280	241700	to get into a highly rejective college,
241700	244180	not because they aren't capable,
244200	250840	but because they weren't given the same advantages as other students.
250860	257560	My mother was a brilliant woman who had an eighth grade education,
257580	261020	and she died when she was just 43 years old
261040	264920	of a totally preventable asthma attack,
264940	267720	because she lived in a rural remote community
267720	272120	and lacked access to health care.
272140	277040	I grew up in poverty, and my test scores were lower,
277060	281060	because I prepared for the SATs by showing up on test day
281080	284800	with a sharpened number two pencil and a calculator,
284820	288200	rather than taking expensive test prep courses.
289480	293840	People sometimes talk about regional public universities
293840	298660	in negative ways by calling some the 13th grade
298680	302980	or saying, anyone can get in, as if that's a bad thing,
303000	306540	or saying they're not real universities.
306560	311820	But shouldn't colleges be judged by how many people they include
311840	315940	and raised to the same level of academic excellence,
315960	319560	rather than by how many people they exclude,
319560	326000	by how well they address the pressing challenges facing their local communities?
326020	330860	Take Adams State University in southern rural Colorado.
330880	334300	Thirty-eight percent of the university's students are Latinx,
334320	339180	and half are first in their families to go to college.
339200	342780	This is Colorado's most affordable university,
342800	346340	and it's one of just a few in the entire country
346340	350160	to offer graduate degrees to students who are currently incarcerated
350180	352640	and working to change their lives.
352660	358860	It contributes $83.5 million each year to the local economy.
360320	364520	Regional public universities like Adams State University
364540	369620	generate more upward mobility than any other type of college.
369640	374680	But you'll never find it on a list of America's most prestigious universities,
374680	378220	and it doesn't get the funding it deserves.
378240	383660	Ironically, the colleges that already have the largest endowments
383680	388200	tend to receive the biggest charitable donations.
388220	393340	Recently, Michael Bloomberg gave Johns Hopkins University
393360	398040	a donation of $1.8 billion.
398060	401140	And this is an incredibly generous gift.
401140	408560	But before the donation, Johns Hopkins had an endowment of $3.8 billion.
408580	414720	And it rejects 89 percent of all students who apply.
414740	416360	By contrast,
416380	418420	Adams State University,
418440	423780	which prides itself by accepting the top 99 percent of students,
423800	428000	has an endowment of just $63,000.
428000	434440	Not million, not billion, $63,000.
434460	436320	Shockingly low.
436340	439380	Now, Johns Hopkins produces vital research,
439400	443060	but let's imagine if Michael Bloomberg had spread that donation
443080	446900	across the 430 RPUs in the country,
446920	451040	each would have received $4 million.
451060	457300	Now, imagine if your net worth went from being $63,000 to $4 million.
457300	460940	Your life would be pretty different, wouldn't it?
460960	464880	Unfortunately, the government only makes this issue worse.
464900	467540	In the United States and throughout the world,
467560	472140	far more public funding goes to highly-rejective colleges
472160	475120	than to regional public universities.
475140	479940	Because of this, RPUs have become more expensive,
479960	482280	which hurts low-income students
482300	486820	and has caused student loan debt to Skyrocket.
486820	490080	If I were 18 years old right now,
490100	494620	I honestly don't know if I could afford to go to college,
494640	497960	given how much tuition has increased
497980	500800	and how little public funding has kept up.
502120	508520	If we really want more low-income students to go to college,
508540	513080	if we really want equity in higher education,
513080	518700	we need to put our money where our mouth is and fund regional public universities.
519700	522900	Now, many of us have been on the receiving end of calls
522920	525040	from our alumni association,
525060	528860	and I don't think the ink was drawn on my diploma when my phone rang.
529860	533500	For my generous friends who may have gone to a highly-rejective college,
533520	535880	and don't worry, I'm not mad at you,
535880	543180	but instead of giving to your alma mater, which is probably already very wealthy,
543200	546900	consider giving it to the colleges that really need it,
546920	550560	to the RPUs that truly serve their communities.
551500	555580	Last year, billionaire philanthropist Mackenzie Scott
555600	561980	gave $1.5 billion to 73 different colleges and universities
561980	565940	that serve low-income students and students of color.
566820	570860	Xavier University of Louisiana, maybe not a household name,
570880	574620	but did you know that they send more black graduates to medical school
574640	577340	than any other college in the country?
577360	579280	She gave them $20 million,
579300	580700	and guess what?
580720	583940	That was the largest gift they had ever received.
583960	587520	And that was true for most of the schools on her list.
587540	589820	Places like Long Beach City College,
589820	592020	the University of Central Florida,
592040	593960	CSU Northridge,
593980	597760	many of these schools are regional public universities
597780	601040	that so rarely get large donations,
601060	604000	that her gift was transformative.
605220	611080	There's no better way than to make a difference in higher education
611100	613560	than to give to the colleges
613580	617440	that change the lives of their students and communities.
617440	619780	But this isn't all about money.
620500	625700	We all have the power to change the way we think about
625720	629300	and talk about regional public universities,
629320	633260	or stop people when they frame them in negative ways.
633780	635740	So when you hear someone saying,
635760	638220	oh, anyone can get into that school,
638240	640780	push them on why that's a bad thing,
640800	642820	you don't have to be rude about it,
642840	645180	you could just say, wow,
645180	648160	wow, that's amazing,
648180	651320	that that school gives so many people
651340	654120	the opportunity to go to college.
656040	657960	I'm living proof
659000	661360	that no matter where you were born,
662580	666000	or how much money your parents have,
666020	670000	you should have the opportunity to go to a college
670000	675140	that supports your growth and fosters your dreams.
675160	679140	When we change the way we define prestige
679160	683860	and fund regional public universities,
683880	688120	we will make higher education equitable once and for all.
688140	689300	Thank you.
689300	703080	Yeah, you can call them.
