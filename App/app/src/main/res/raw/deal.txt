Because I'm a college professor, I'm going to start with a pop quiz.
8
14
I want you to think of the best college in the country,
14
18
one that you would absolutely love to get into,
19
22
one that would change your life completely.
22
25
Okay, do you have it?
25
27
I'm guessing if I went to the audience right now
27
32
and asked a hundred different people which college they chose,
32
37
I'd hear the same names over and over and over again.
37
42
And that's because we have a huge problem in higher education.
42
46
We say we want colleges to be more equitable,
46
50
more transformational, more accessible.
50
54
But we tend to obsess over a tiny group of colleges
54
57
most of us could never get into.
57
60
And it's not because we aren't smart enough.
60
63
It's because there isn't enough space for all of us.
63
68
These schools intentionally cap the number of students that they accept.
68
72
It's why Achille Bello, an advocate for fairness in college admissions,
72
74
calls them something else.
74
78
They're not prestigious universities.
78
81
They're highly rejective colleges.
81
87
I'm not saying these schools are bad.
87
92
Places like Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Princeton, MIT,
92
95
and I'm not saying these schools are bad.
95
99
They're obviously major research institutions.
99
102
But our cultural obsession with a limited group
102
108
of highly rejective colleges has major consequences.
108
112
I'm a person in my immediate family to graduate from college.
112
119
And Portland State University,
119
122
a regional public university in Portland, Oregon,
122
125
truly changed my life.
125
130
But for a long time,
130
134
when someone at a networking event asked me where I went to college,
134
140
I worried that they judged my intellect and my aspirations when I answered.
140
142
Now I research higher education
142
147
to understand how our perceptions of which colleges are good
147
152
shape important decisions we make about which schools to fund,
152
157
donate to, attend, and send our children to.
157
161
Regional public universities, or RPUs for short,
161
165
are the exact opposite of highly rejective colleges.
165
170
You can spot them because their name tells you which communities they serve.
170
173
Western Colorado University,
173
175
Northern Kentucky University,
175
178
Eastern Washington University.
178
182
In New York, they're the SUNY and the CUNY schools.
182
187
In California, they're the 23 CSU campuses.
187
191
They're called normal schools in China, Fauschulen in Germany,
191
196
and provincial colleges in Canada and Italy.
196
199
These are the universities that train the nurses
199
202
who take care of you when you go to the hospital,
202
205
the school teachers who educate your children,
205
211
and the small business leaders that create jobs in your hometown.
211
214
Regional public universities, or RPUs,
214
220
pride themselves on accepting everyone, or almost everyone who applies.
220
224
And RPUs students are more likely to be first-generation college students
224
229
like I was, students of color, low-income students,
229
235
veterans, and adults balancing work and family while going to school.
235
239
And RPUs students often don't have the test scores required
239
241
to get into a highly rejective college,
241
244
not because they aren't capable,
244
250
but because they weren't given the same advantages as other students.
250
257
My mother was a brilliant woman who had an eighth grade education,
257
261
and she died when she was just 43 years old
261
264
of a totally preventable asthma attack,
264
267
because she lived in a rural remote community
267
272
and lacked access to health care.
272
277
I grew up in poverty, and my test scores were lower,
277
281
because I prepared for the SATs by showing up on test day
281
284
with a sharpened number two pencil and a calculator,
284
288
rather than taking expensive test prep courses.
289
293
People sometimes talk about regional public universities
293
298
in negative ways by calling some the 13th grade
298
302
or saying, anyone can get in, as if that's a bad thing,
303
306
or saying they're not real universities.
306
311
But shouldn't colleges be judged by how many people they include
311
315
and raised to the same level of academic excellence,
315
319
rather than by how many people they exclude,
319
326
by how well they address the pressing challenges facing their local communities?
326
330
Take Adams State University in southern rural Colorado.
330
334
Thirty-eight percent of the university's students are Latinx,
334
339
and half are first in their families to go to college.
339
342
This is Colorado's most affordable university,
342
346
and it's one of just a few in the entire country
346
350
to offer graduate degrees to students who are currently incarcerated
350
352
and working to change their lives.
352
358
It contributes $83.5 million each year to the local economy.
360
364
Regional public universities like Adams State University
364
369
generate more upward mobility than any other type of college.
369
374
But you'll never find it on a list of America's most prestigious universities,
374
378
and it doesn't get the funding it deserves.
378
383
Ironically, the colleges that already have the largest endowments
383
388
tend to receive the biggest charitable donations.
388
393
Recently, Michael Bloomberg gave Johns Hopkins University
393
398
a donation of $1.8 billion.
398
401
And this is an incredibly generous gift.
401
408
But before the donation, Johns Hopkins had an endowment of $3.8 billion.
408
414
And it rejects 89 percent of all students who apply.
414
416
By contrast,
416
418
Adams State University,
418
423
which prides itself by accepting the top 99 percent of students,
423
428
has an endowment of just $63,000.
428
434
Not million, not billion, $63,000.
434
436
Shockingly low.
436
439
Now, Johns Hopkins produces vital research,
439
443
but let's imagine if Michael Bloomberg had spread that donation
443
446
across the 430 RPUs in the country,
446
451
each would have received $4 million.
451
457
Now, imagine if your net worth went from being $63,000 to $4 million.
457
460
Your life would be pretty different, wouldn't it?
460
464
Unfortunately, the government only makes this issue worse.
464
467
In the United States and throughout the world,
467
472
far more public funding goes to highly-rejective colleges
472
475
than to regional public universities.
475
479
Because of this, RPUs have become more expensive,
479
482
which hurts low-income students
482
486
and has caused student loan debt to Skyrocket.
486
490
If I were 18 years old right now,
490
494
I honestly don't know if I could afford to go to college,
494
497
given how much tuition has increased
497
500
and how little public funding has kept up.
502
508
If we really want more low-income students to go to college,
508
513
if we really want equity in higher education,
513
518
we need to put our money where our mouth is and fund regional public universities.
519
522
Now, many of us have been on the receiving end of calls
522
525
from our alumni association,
525
528
and I don't think the ink was drawn on my diploma when my phone rang.
529
533
For my generous friends who may have gone to a highly-rejective college,
533
535
and don't worry, I'm not mad at you,
535
543
but instead of giving to your alma mater, which is probably already very wealthy,
543
546
consider giving it to the colleges that really need it,
546
550
to the RPUs that truly serve their communities.
551
555
Last year, billionaire philanthropist Mackenzie Scott
555
561
gave $1.5 billion to 73 different colleges and universities
561
565
that serve low-income students and students of color.
566
570
Xavier University of Louisiana, maybe not a household name,
570
574
but did you know that they send more black graduates to medical school
574
577
than any other college in the country?
577
579
She gave them $20 million,
579
580
and guess what?
580
583
That was the largest gift they had ever received.
583
587
And that was true for most of the schools on her list.
587
589
Places like Long Beach City College,
589
592
the University of Central Florida,
592
593
CSU Northridge,
593
597
many of these schools are regional public universities
597
601
that so rarely get large donations,
601
604
that her gift was transformative.
605
611
There's no better way than to make a difference in higher education
611
613
than to give to the colleges
613
617
that change the lives of their students and communities.
617
619
But this isn't all about money.
620
625
We all have the power to change the way we think about
625
629
and talk about regional public universities,
629
633
or stop people when they frame them in negative ways.
633
635
So when you hear someone saying,
635
638
oh, anyone can get into that school,
638
640
push them on why that's a bad thing,
640
642
you don't have to be rude about it,
642
645
you could just say, wow,
645
648
wow, that's amazing,
648
651
that that school gives so many people
651
654
the opportunity to go to college.
656
657
I'm living proof
659
661
that no matter where you were born,
662
666
or how much money your parents have,
666
670
you should have the opportunity to go to a college
670
675
that supports your growth and fosters your dreams.
675
679
When we change the way we define prestige
679
683
and fund regional public universities,
683
688
we will make higher education equitable once and for all.
688
689
Thank you.
689
703
Yeah, you can call them.
